        <div class="box">
            <div class="">
                <ul>
                    <li>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born to Jainulabdeen, a boat owner and Imam, and
                        Ashiamma, a housewife. Kalam had four brothers and a sister, all elder to him.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Kalam studied at a school in Ramanathapuram and acquired a degree in Physics from Saint Joseph’s
                        College, Tiruchirappalli. In 1955, he went to the Madras Institute of Technology to pursue
                        aerospace engineering. His dream of becoming a fighter pilot was thwarted when he missed the
                        qualifier by a narrow margin. He was ranked ninth but only 8 positions were available with the
                        IAF.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) in 1969. At ISRO, he was
                        the Project Director of the satellite launch vehicle (SLV) that successfully deployed the
                        satellite Rohini into orbit in 1980. It was India’s first SLV.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Although Kalam’s ancestors had been wealthy traders, the family had descended into difficult
                        times and Kalam used to sell newspapers as a child to add-on to his family’s modest income.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After that, he got a job as a scientist at the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the
                        Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). He also worked under eminent scientist
                        Vikram Sarabhai.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Kalam also worked to develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        He was also the director of two projects, Project Valiant and Project Devil for developing
                        ballistic missiles from the SLV technology. His research and leadership led him to the
                        directorship of an advanced missile development programme.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In 2002, Abdul Kalam was elected the 11th President of India. He had won by a huge margin. He
                        was the first scientist to become India’s President and incidentally the first bachelor too.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Despite pressure from the people to have him stand for a second term, he decided not to contest.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Kalam’s term as the president which lasted the full term till 2007 was beneficial for the office
                        of the president itself. He came to be called the People’s President. His popularity soared
                        among the people, especially school children. He visited many parts of the country and his
                        speeches became popular for their motivational content.
